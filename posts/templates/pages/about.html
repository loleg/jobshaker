Jobshaker is not a standard job-searching site. We connect you with like-minded people who share your professional aims and interests - you take it from there. Jobshaker is entirely free and secure as you only share as much personal information as you chose. </span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">How does Jobshaker work?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>After registering and creating your professional profile, you will be able to post to the jobshaker board. For each post you are asked to indicate whether you are looking for a jobsharing partner, a business partner or a project partner. You can also specify which skills and interests your future partner should bring and the location, time and duration of the partnership. You can create as many posts as you like. Jobshaker members can view all the created posts on the board and search them by location and keywords. You can contact other members easily and securely through jobshaker.</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Why Jobshaker?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>As a young couple who recently had the joy of welcoming their first baby, we are frustrated with the often inflexible and uncreative job situation in Switzerland. Like you, we want it all: to make a contribution to our community, to use our skills and expertise in a meaningful way, to make a living and to spend lots of time with our families and friends. Jobshaker is our tool to connect to like-minded people who want to join us in creating their own opportunities and to explore alternative ways of work - jobsharing, building and growing a business and work on meaningful projects.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What can I do for Jobshaker?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>This is the very first version of Jobshaker. We need your help and contribution to make it into the awesome, useful tool that we envision. So please get in touch with your comments, critique and suggestions.</span></p>
