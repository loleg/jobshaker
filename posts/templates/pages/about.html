<h4>What is Jobshaker?</h4>

<p>Jobshaker is your platform to find professional partners in Switzerland for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_sharing">job sharing</a>, building a business or working jointly on a project. Jobshaker is not a standard job searching site. We wish to connect you with like-minded people who share your goals and interests, then let you take it from there. Jobshaker is entirely free and secure: share only as much personal information as you choose.</p>

<h4>How does Jobshaker work?</h4>

<p>After registering and creating your professional profile, you will be able to post to the Jobshaker board. For each post you are asked to indicate whether you are looking for a jobsharing partner, a business partner or a project partner. You can also specify which skills and interests your future partner should bring and the location, time and duration of the partnership.</p>

<p>Create as many posts as you like. Jobshaker members can view all the created posts on the board and search them by location and keywords. You can contact other members easily and securely by replying to their Posts. Replies are private, though by starring or flagging posts you can quickly share your opinion with the community.</p>

<h4>Why Jobshaker?</h4>

<p>As a young couple who recently had their first baby, we are frustrated with the often inflexible job market in Switzerland. Like you, we want it all: to make a contribution to our community, use our skills and expertise in a meaningful way while making a living, and spend time with our families and friends. Jobshaker is our tool to connect to like-minded people who want to join us in creating their own opportunities and to explore alternative ways of work: job sharing, building and growing a business and working on meaningful projects.</p>

<h4>What can I do for Jobshaker?</h4>

<p>This is the very first version of Jobshaker. We need your help and contribution to make it into the awesomely useful tool that we envision. So please get in touch with your comments, critiques and suggestions through our survey below, or share ideas or questions with everyone on the User Voice forum.</p>
